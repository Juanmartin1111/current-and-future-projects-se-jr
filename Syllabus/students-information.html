            <h2>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</h2>
            <p >Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
                in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would
                like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
                Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
                an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since
                accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
                recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
                not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
                information about academic support services, visit the website at:
                www.lewisu.edu/CASE. </p>
            <p> Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
                uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
                Alternative Formats </p>
        
            <h2 >Sanctified Zone </h2> 
            <p>Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
                fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
                Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
                University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
                The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are 
                a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
                each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:
                http://www.lewisu.edu/sanctified zone</p> 
        
            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p>Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
                forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
                University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
                expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
                considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
                instructorâ€™s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
                Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
                college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
                except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
                Provost makes the final decision. </p>
