            <p >Course: Software Engineering (CPSC-44000-LT1)
                Course Credit Hours: 3
                Course description:
                Methods, strategies, and tools for implementing software systems, particularly as part
                of a development team. Topics include the software development life cycle, Unified
                Modeling Language, software testing techniques, software security, open-source
                development, requirements gathering and documentation, maintenance, and basic
                software project management.
                Prerequisites: CPSC-24500 Object-Oriented Programming
                Course meeting times: MWF 12-12:50am CT from August 31 through December 12th
                Meeting location: AS 104A
                Course final: Monday, December 14th from 1:30 to 3:30pm CT</p>
            
            <p class="w3-justify">Student Learning Outcomes:
                1. compare and contrast various software process models
                2. be able to elicit and analyze requirements of a proposed application
                3. write clear and complete requirements documents
                4. identify the events to which the software must respond and document them as a set of use
                cases
                5. identify security issues in a software projects requirements and design
                6. use techniques to produce self-documenting code
                7. use coding strategy to produce secure code
                8. draw diagrams to model workflows
                9. develop and use diagrams to model classes and the interaction of classes
                10. understand and practice unit testing and functional testing
                11. understand the techniques used to test non-functional requirements such as performance and
                security
                12. develop a project schedule
                Program student learning outcomes:
                1. develop programs using languages having different programming paradigms and for a variety of
                platforms
                2. select the most appropriate data structures and algorithms for the given problem
                7. explain how programming languages are designed and implemented
                Baccalaureate Characteristics:
                1. Essential Skills
                6. Critical Thinking</p>
