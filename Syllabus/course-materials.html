            <p class="w3-justify"> E-Learning Headphone with Microphone: Our blended classroom setting
                requires a wired computer headset with a microphone for both in person and
                online participation. </p>
            <p class="w3-justify"> Supplemental readings, videos, online materials: Additional readings, videos, and
                online materials will be provided. </p>
            <p class="w3-justify"> Hardware and software requirements: This course requires access to multiple
                software tools. There are generally available for free but will need to be installed and
                utilized from a Windows or Macintosh computer. </p>
            <p class="w3-justify"> Other required materials or costs: During this course we will be setting up and utilizing
                GitHub and Microsoft Azure accounts. We will be able to complete course assignments
                utilizing these resources for free or at a very low cost (estimated less than $20). A credit
                card will be needed to sign up for these accounts. </p>
