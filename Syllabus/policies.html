            <h2>Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</h2>
            <h2>Responsiveness to Change</h2>
            <p> Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
                semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to
                any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
                Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
                planned modality this course.</p>
            <h2>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</h2>
            <p> Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
                committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
                Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
                Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
                impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
                college Deanâ€™s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
                will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
                evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.
                Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
                COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
                interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
                for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
                836-5593 or learningaccess@lewisu.edu to request an appointment.</p>
            <h2>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning </h2>
            <p> Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
                physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
                mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
                obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
                the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
                cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
                faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins</p>
