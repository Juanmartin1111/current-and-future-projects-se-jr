                    Lewis University, guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, provides to a diverse
                student population programs for a liberal and professional education grounded in the
                interaction of knowledge and fidelity in the search for truth.
                Lewis promotes the development of the complete person through the pursuit of wisdom
                and justice. Fundamental to its Mission is a spirit of association, which fosters
                community in all teaching, learning and service.
                How this course connects to the University Mission:
                This course will allow us to extend our knowledge in software development, provide us
                the foundation for lifelong learning in this domain, and provide us the opportunity to
                assist each other on our learning journey.</td>
